# my-canary-blog:

This is a simple back-end web application developed to practice on my React.js skills. Node.js and Git Bash terminals
were also used, as well as MongoDB for the database. I followed a LinkedIn Learning-tutorial during March 2021 to create this blog.
The blog only contains random content taken from the Internet. The corresponding front-end you can find under: RaidaT/my-canary-blog.
